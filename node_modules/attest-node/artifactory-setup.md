# Deque Registry Setup

## Pre-Requisites

You will need your registry username and password and your company-id from Deque Systems in order to perform these commands

## Attest Registry

Execute the following command `curl -uusername:password "https://agora.dequecloud.com/artifactory/api/npm/attest-virtual/auth/deque"`

Take the resulting lines and edit your `~/.npmrc` file and add them to that file.

## Your Company's Custom Rules Registry

Set up your access to your company's rule repository with the following command. Replace "company-id" with the ID supplied by Deque Systems. Replace "uniqueid" with a scope identifier that is unique to your local configuration (example "attestrules")

```
curl -uusername:password "https://agora.dequecloud.com/artifactory/api/npm/company-id/auth/uniqueid"```

Add the resulting lines to the `~/.npmrc` file in the same way as for the Attest Registry above.
