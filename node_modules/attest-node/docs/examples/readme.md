In order to run this example you will need to have the following installed:

- NodeJS (and NPM) https://nodejs.org
- Firefox webdriver https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/FirefoxDriver

To install the example, and run the test use:

```
$ npm install --save-dev attest-node attest-webdriverjs --registry https://agora.dequecloud.com/artifactory/api/npm/attest-virtual/
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

This will first get all the node modules needed to run this example. Then NPM will start a mocha test on the attest-mocha.js file. This starts off by defining this test, using `reporter = attestReport.init('Deque a11y test', './a11y-results');`.

This creates a directory at ./a11y-results, where the results of the Deque a11y test will be stored. Each page in this test will subsequently be tested with axe, and by calling `reporter.logTestResult(pageName, results)` the results are saved in a JSON format to the ./a11y-results directory.

Once `npm test` is done, npm will run it's posttest script. This will use attest-report to take all the results in the a11y-results directory, and create an HTML report using the results obtained during the test run.
