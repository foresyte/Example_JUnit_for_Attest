Attest Reporter Data Format
===========================

The Attest-reporter will take the results of test runs with axe-core and package them in such a way that they can be saved as reports. Each report is made up of one or more test runs with the same 'name' property.

Each test run will be saved using the following format:

```javascript
// testDir/testName-testID-isoDateTime.json
{
	"type": "attest-result",
	"name": "some name",
	"id": "identify state name is in",
	"endTime": "DATETIME"
	"platform": {
		userAgent: 'PhantomJS',
		testMachine: "SOMENAMEIDVALUE"
	}
	"testSubject": {
		fileName: '',
		lineNumber: '',
		state: ''
	},
	findings: {
		violations: [{
			id: '',
			description: '',
			help: '',
			helpUrl: '',
			impact: '',
			tags: [],
			nodes: []
		}/* ... */],
		passes: [{
			id: '',
			description: '',
			help: '',
			helpUrl: '',
			impact: '',
			tags: []
		}/* ... */]
	}
}
```
